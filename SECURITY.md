# Security Policy & Vulnerability Management

## 1. Security Architecture & Scope Overview

The **Legendary Volume Game by LTW v2.0** is engineered around strict zero-trust and client-side execution principles. While the actual application source code is **not published in this repository**, the application architecture relies exclusively on browser-native Three.js WebGL rendering, 2D HTML5 canvas primitives, and local JavaScript evaluation engines to eliminate network exposure and remote server vulnerabilities.

This repository hosts official governance documents, technical specifications, and security policies.

## 3. Vulnerability Reporting Guidelines

Security, mathematical integrity, and rendering safety are top priorities for this project. If you identify a potential security flaw, logic vulnerability, or input handling weakness within the documented specifications, please follow the responsible disclosure procedure:

### Reporting Procedure
1. **Do NOT Create Public Issues:** Do **NOT** open public GitHub issues or discussions regarding security vulnerabilities or technical exploits.
2. **Private Disclosure Channel:** Submit your findings privately via GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled) or directly through official, verified contact to [W L T Weerasinghe](mailto:wltweerasinghe@gmail.com).
3. **Information to Include:**
   * Detailed description of the suspected flaw or edge case.
   * Specific document or specification reference.
   * Conceptual proof-of-concept (PoC) or reproduction steps, if applicable.
   * Potential security or application impact assessment.

## 4. Response & Disclosure Timeline

Upon receipt of a private security report:
- **Acknowledgment:** All legitimate reports will be thoroughly investigated, and updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
- **Assessment:** The report will be reviewed privately against the core codebase.
- **Resolution:** If a valid flaw is identified, remedial measures will be implemented immediately within the private codebase and updated in the public specifications.
